        <h1>Intent and Process</h1>
       <div class="paragraph--left2">
        <p>
        The intentions of the website is to inform users about climate change and 
        the negative impacts it has on polar bear subpopulations reproductive rates;
        limiting their resources, unable for them to thrive in their environments due 
        to planet temperatures rising and ice melting. The goal of the site is to intrigue 
        users to want to participtate and recieve knowledge about the Paris Agreement; whether 
        it is for individuals to learn how they can be more green or if the user wants to know what 
        the Paris Agreement is.<br><br>
        My process for designing the website was starting with finding the proper resources; allowing the sources
        to help pick my design process. Once I gathered the information, I drew the visual representation for the data that 
        highlighted the information in the paragraphs. Which helped me decide on the grid layout that would be the most benefical and easy to read. 
        I decided on a scroll page website because it resembles most to a digital book and does not require plenty of effort from the user. After all
        the Information collected, it allowed for a easy coding process.
