                    <p>As stated on the United Nations website, Climate Change refers to <strong>long-term shifts</strong> in weather patterns and <strong>temperatures</strong>; 
                        some shifts may be natural due to variations in the solar cycle. Although since the 1800’s <strong>human activities</strong> have played a 
                        large role in <strong>intensifying</strong> the process/effects of climate change primarily due to <strong>burning fossil fuels</strong> like oil, gas and coal. 
                        The greenhouse gas emissions that are released from burning fossil fuels effect the Earth by trapping the sun’s heat and raising temperatures; 
                        some examples that are causing climate change include transportation, electricity/heat and even the garbage in our landfills.</p>

                    <p>With Climate Change excelling, we have seen the effects it has on our way of living; we aren't the only species being affected by our planet slowly burning.
                         Polar bears international website speaks on recent research on how <strong>polar bear subpopulations reproductive and survival rates</strong> are at <strong>stake</strong>; due to <strong>declining 
                         ice loss</strong> in environments. Polar bears rely heavily on ice and cold temperatures for capturing their prey- without access to proper environment conditions, 
                         it <strong>prolongs fasting periods</strong> which results in food deprived body conditions, low reproductive rates due to lack of energy and lower rates of survival. Continuing
                         <strong>sea ice loss threatens the likelihood of success within the polar bear subpopulations.</strong> In 2015 world leaders at the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris set long
                         term goals to tackle climate change due to the negative impacts- The Paris Agreement.

                        The Paris agreement is a <strong>legally</strong> binding international treaty that has <strong>goals to tackle the negative impact climate change</strong> has on our planet. As stated from the 
                        United Nations official website, the goal for the agreement is to substantially <strong>reduce global greenhouse gas emissions</strong>; hopefully <strong>limiting the global temperature increase</strong> in this 
                        century to two degrees. While pursuing efforts to limit the increase even further to one and a half degrees. The government is doing their part by <strong>providing financial support to countries</strong>
                        to mitigate climate change and reviewing the agreement every five years, <strong>what can we do as individuals do to help embrace the Paris Agreement</strong> and limit the negative impacts of climate change?

        <p>Polar Bear International Society had the opportunity of researching

        to no data is collected on the remaining 6 subpopulations. <strong>Two scenarios are presented</strong>; If society <strong>follows the Paris Agreement or if society goes against it</strong> and how the lowering/excelling 
       of temperatures will affect reproductive rates in each subpopulation.
