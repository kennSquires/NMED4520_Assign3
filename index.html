                    <p>As stated on the United Nations website, Climate Change refers to <strong>long-term shifts</strong> in weather patterns and <strong>temperatures</strong>; 
                        some shifts may be natural due to variations in the solar cycle. Although since the 1800’s <strong>human activities</strong> have played a 
                        large role in <strong>intensifying</strong> the process/effects of climate change primarily due to <strong>burning fossil fuels</strong> like oil, gas and coal. 
                        The greenhouse gas emissions that are released from burning fossil fuels effect the Earth by trapping the sun’s heat and raising temperatures; 
                        some examples that are causing climate change include transportation, electricity/heat and even the garbage in our landfills.</p>

                         Polar bears international website speaks on recent research on how polar bear subpopulations reproductive and survival rates are at stake; due to declining 
                         ice loss in environments. Polar bears rely heavily on ice and cold temperatures for capturing their prey- without access to proper environment conditions, 
                         it prolongs fasting periods which results in food deprived body conditions, low reproductive rates due to lack of energy and lower rates of survival. Continuing
                         sea ice loss threatens the likelihood of success within the polar bear subpopulations. In 2015 world leaders at the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris set long
                         term goals to tackle climate change due to the negative impacts- The Paris Agreement.

                        The Paris agreement is a legally binding international treaty that has goals to tackle the negative impact climate change has on our planet. As stated from the 
                        United Nations official website, the goal for the agreement is to substantially reduce global greenhouse gas emissions; hopefully limiting the global temperature increase in this 
                        century to two degrees. While pursuing efforts to limit the increase even further to one and a half degrees. The government is doing their part by providing financial support to countries
                        to mitigate climate change and reviewing the agreement every five years, what can we do as individuals do to help embrace the Paris Agreement and limit the negative impacts of climate change?
